# imperfect-utils
I'm on a quest to make a suite of random command line utilities. Thus far they have not been of utmost quality (hence "imperfect"), but that's no reason to quit :).

## Table of Contents

### General Tools
`repl.sh` - Simulates a "read, eval, print" loop (currently supports C, C++, and Java)

`music-player.sh` - A music player (Requires FFMPEG, awk)

`memory-usage-analyzer.cpp` - Statically analyzes C++ source code to approximate how much stack memory is allocated in total

### Games
`whiskers-revenge.cpp` - Your dog has eaten your cat's friskies for the third time this week. You're placed in the shoes of your cat, Mr. Whiskers -- chase your dog and capture him in as few moves as possible. _To play_: Queue the perfect combination of directions (_wasd_) to try to catch the dog in one move.
