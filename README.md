# imperfect-utils
I'm on a quest to make a suite of random command line utilities. Thus far they have not been of utmost quality (hence "imperfect"), but that's no reason to quit :).

## Table of Contents

### General Tools
`cpp-repl.sh` - Simulates a "read, eval, print" loop for C++

`music-player.sh` - A music player (Requires FFMPEG, awk)

`memory-usage-analyzer.cpp` - Statically analyzes C++ source code to approximate how much stack memory is allocated in total

### Games
`snake-golf.cpp` - Queue the perfect combination of moves to bring your snake to the apple in as few moves as possible
